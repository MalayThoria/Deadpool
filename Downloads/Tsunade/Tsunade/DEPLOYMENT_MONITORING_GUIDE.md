✅ **GitHub Actions Workflow Triggered**
🔄 **Railway Deployment In Progress**
⏳ **Frontend Integration Pending**

## 🔍 Step 1: Monitor GitHub Actions Deployment

### Check Deployment Status

1. **Go to GitHub Actions**:
   - URL: https://github.com/MalayThoria/Deadpool/actions
   - Look for the latest workflow run
   - Should show "Trigger Railway deployment with configured GitHub secrets"

2. **Monitor Workflow Progress**:
   - Click on the latest workflow run
   - Watch the `deploy-backend-railway` job
   - Look for these key steps:
     - ✅ Install Railway CLI
     - ✅ Login to Railway
     - ✅ Deploy backend service
     - ✅ Get deployment URL
     - ✅ Health check
     - ✅ Slack notification (if configured)

3. **Get Railway Deployment URL**:
   - In the workflow logs, look for:
     ```
     Railway deployment URL: https://your-app-name.railway.app
     ```
   - Copy this URL - you'll need it for frontend configuration

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**If deployment fails:**

1. **Check GitHub Secrets**:
   - Ensure all required secrets are set
   - Verify Railway token is correct

2. **Check Railway Dashboard**:
   - Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Look for your deployed service
   - Check logs for any errors

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your service
   - Click "Variables" tab
   - Ensure all required variables are set

## 🔗 Step 2: Test Backend Deployment

### Health Check

Once deployment completes, test your backend:

```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway URL
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "Rx Assistant API"
}
```

### API Documentation

Access your API docs:
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app/docs
```

## 🎯 Step 3: Configure Frontend (Vercel)

### Option A: Use Automated Script

1. **Run the update script**:
   ```powershell
   .\update-vercel-config.ps1
   ```

2. **Enter your Railway URL** when prompted:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.railway.app
   ```

### Option B: Manual Configuration

1. **Update Frontend Environment Variables**:
   
   **File: `frontend/.env.local`**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
   ```

2. **Update Vercel Environment Variables**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Update these variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`

3. **Redeploy Vercel Frontend**:
   ```bash
   # In frontend directory
   npm run build
   vercel --prod
   ```

## ⚙️ Step 4: Configure CORS on Railway

### Update Railway Environment Variables

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**:
   - https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Select your deployed service

2. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```env
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Redeploy Railway Service**:
   - Click "Deploy" or trigger a new deployment

## 🧪 Step 5: Test Full Stack Integration

### Frontend-Backend Connection Test

1. **Open your Vercel frontend**:
   ```
   https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
   ```

2. **Test API calls**:
   - Try user registration/login
   - Test any API endpoints
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Open browser DevTools
   - Go to Network tab
   - Verify API calls are going to Railway URL
   - Check for CORS errors

### Health Check from Frontend

Add this test to your frontend:
```javascript
// Test backend connection
fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}/health`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Backend health:', data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Backend connection failed:', error));
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Backend (Railway)
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- [ ] Railway service is running
- [ ] Health endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] API documentation is accessible
- [ ] Environment variables are configured
- [ ] CORS is properly configured

### Frontend (Vercel)
- [ ] Environment variables updated with Railway URL
- [ ] Frontend redeployed with new configuration
- [ ] API calls are reaching Railway backend
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] All features working end-to-end

## 🔧 Common Railway URLs

**Your Railway service will be available at:**
- Main URL: `https://[service-name]-[random-id].railway.app`
- Health Check: `https://[service-name]-[random-id].railway.app/health`
- API Docs: `https://[service-name]-[random-id].railway.app/docs`
- API Base: `https://[service-name]-[random-id].railway.app/api/v1`

## 🎉 Success Indicators

**You'll know everything is working when:**

1. ✅ GitHub Actions shows green checkmarks
2. ✅ Railway dashboard shows service as "Active"
3. ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
4. ✅ Frontend can make API calls without CORS errors
5. ✅ User registration/login works end-to-end
6. ✅ All application features function properly

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow** (should complete in 5-10 minutes)
2. **Get the Railway deployment URL** from the workflow logs
3. **Test the backend health endpoint**
4. **Configure your Vercel frontend** with the Railway URL
5. **Test the complete application** end-to-end
